## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context, or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

**Quick reference:**
- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd update --claim <issue_id>` - Atomically claim unblocked work (set BD_ACTOR to something unique
  per-session)
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd dolt push` - Push beads to remote

For full workflow details: `bd prime`
